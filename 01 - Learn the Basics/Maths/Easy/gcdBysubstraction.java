        // The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor
        // (GCD)
        // of two numbers. It operates on the principle that the GCD of two numbers
        // remains
        // the same even if the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number.

        // To find the GCD of n1 and n2 where n1 > n2:
        // 1. Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of
        // them becomes 0.
        // 2. Once one becomes 0, the other is the GCD of the original numbers.

        // Example:
        // n1 = 20, n2 = 15

        // gcd(20, 15) = gcd(20 - 15, 15) = gcd(5, 15)
        // gcd(5, 15) = gcd(15 - 5, 5) = gcd(10, 5)
        // gcd(10, 5) = gcd(10 - 5, 5) = gcd(5, 5)
        // gcd(5, 5) = gcd(5 - 5, 5) = gcd(0, 5)

        // Hence, return 5 as the GCD.
